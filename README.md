# Fall-23-Tenets-of-Good-Visualisation

What makes a good chart? How to ideate the right chart for the story you want to tell? Which charts call for bespoke solutions? When is it good to follow the rules, when is it good to break them? We answer these questions and more, and introduce you to Observable for quick prototyping and exploratory data viz.
